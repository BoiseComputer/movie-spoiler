## How to use

1. Clone the repository
2. Run the script with the following command:

```bash
python3 spoiler.py
```

3. Follow the instructions on the screen

## How it works

The script will ask you for the name of the movie you want to spoil. It will then search for the movie on the [OMDb API](http://www.omdbapi.com/) and get the plot of the movie. It will then ask you how many words you want to reveal at a time. It will then reveal the plot of the movie word by word with a delay between each word.

## Disclaimer

This script was made for fun and should not be used to spoil movies for people who don't want to be spoiled. Use at your own risk.
